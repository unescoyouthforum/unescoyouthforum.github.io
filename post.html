            <p>The event does not occur only in one city but across the world. The term ‘Global’ already depicts an event that has received recognition all across the world. The more than 130 cities across all continents involved are allowed to conduct the event in different ways but with one goal in mind; spreading awareness and a call to action for governments to protect the plight of the planet’s non-human species.</p>

            <p>Elephants, rhinos, and lions top the list of wild animals on the verge of extinction. This is owed to human activities such as land encroachment leading to habitat loss, poaching, sports hunting among others. The unpredictable weather conditions leading to drought in Sub Saharan Africa and Flooding in the Asian continent, where these species are predominantly found, also reduces the number of individual species.</p>

            <p>Not everyone may agree with protecting animal rights, more so in developing countries where we face various challenges. As populations continue to grow, people need to be fed. </p>

            <p>In a world where there are those who believe hunting protects wildlife and does not cause harm in any way and that  poached animals and plants goods provide  luxury or medication, a lot of awareness needs to be done. Awareness at both the grassroots and urban levels</p>

            <p>Elephants, rhinos, and lions are considered to be keystone species. Species that play a huge role in the ecosystem and losing them to extinction will cause a global ecosystem imbalance.</p>

            <p>At 8AM, we gather around museum hill at National Museums of Kenya to partake in THE GLOBAL MARCH FOR ELEPHANTS ,RHINOS AND LIONS. The turnout was spectacular, a large crowd of animal enthusiasts who were excited to take part in a very noble cause.</p>

            <p>In the crowd were volunteers and participants from all over the country. The Cabinet Secretary,Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources,arrived later. It was an event graced by people from all walks of life with a common purpose.</p>

           <p>Before we began the walk officially, we joined in the conservation song by SUSO and received welcoming remarks by Director General,National Museums of Kenya.

            <p>After a statement by the Cabinet Secretary,Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the march is flagged off and the procession began through uhuru highway, T-mall, and Lang’ata road eventually ending at KWS headquarters in Lang’ata.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The march was exciting with cheer songs and enchantments of animal justice being thrown here and there. The march pulled attention to the public at large engaging the general public in the noble cause, perhaps, having achieved its goal of awareness to the public at large.</blockquote>
